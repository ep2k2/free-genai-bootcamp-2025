# Code rules

- write and format code according to the languages and technologies used e.g. Pythonic for Python

- this is a simple prototype project so no need for complex code structure, full error-handling or testing

- when we're coding we need uvicorn running to serve the FastAPI app
-- the FastAPI app should be running at http://localhost:8000 
-- command to run uvicorn: "/mnt/c/free-genai-bootcamp-2025/venv/bin/uvicorn backend-lang-portal.main:app --reload"
