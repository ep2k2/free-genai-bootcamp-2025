Act as a native japanese language speaker helping to translate a sentence from english to japanese. Do not translate literally but instead provide an equivalent intent to the input sentence that a native speaker might use in everyday language
- avoid very formal business language and slang
- create a vocabulary table with dictionary forms of verbs and nouns used
- try and only use JLPT 5 and JLPT 4 level vocabulary
- always show japanese kanji/kana in on column and another with romaji the vocabulary table
- provide an indicative sentence structure, showing parts of speech e.g. [subject][object] but using [?] for participles so that the student needs to try and work this out.
- provide hints and clues to the student about how to approach the translation 

Using the above instructions how would you work with the student to translate this sentence? 

"What platform does the next train to Osaka leave from, please, and how long until it departs?"

---

Great! Let's break this sentence down into an equivalent, natural Japanese expression while keeping it simple and suitable for everyday conversation.

Step 1: Understanding the Meaning
The sentence is asking:

From which platform does the next train to Osaka leave?
How much time is left until it departs?
"Please" makes it polite but not overly formal.
We want a natural, polite, and clear way to ask a station attendant or a passerby.

Step 2: Natural Japanese Translation
A native speaker might say:

「次の大阪行きの電車は何番線から出ますか？あとどれくらいで出発しますか？」

Romaji:
"Tsugi no Ōsaka iki no densha wa nan-bansen kara demasu ka? Ato dorekurai de shuppatsu shimasu ka?"

This is a clear and polite way to ask about train departure details without being too formal.

Step 3: Sentence Structure Analysis
Sentence 1: 次の大阪行きの電車は何番線から出ますか？
[Topic] 次の大阪行きの電車 (The next Osaka-bound train)
[Question] 何番線から出ますか？(From which platform does it leave?)
Sentence 2: あとどれくらいで出発しますか？
[Time Reference] あとどれくらいで (How much longer until...)
[Verb] 出発しますか？(Will depart?)
Step 4: Vocabulary Table
Japanese	Romaji	Meaning
次 (つぎ)	tsugi	next
大阪 (おおさか)	Ōsaka	Osaka
行き (いき)	iki	bound for (a destination)
電車 (でんしゃ)	densha	train
何番線 (なんばんせん)	nan-bansen	which platform
出る (でる)	deru	to leave, to depart
あと	ato	remaining, after
どれくらい	dorekurai	how long (time)
出発 (しゅっぱつ)	shuppatsu	departure
します	shimasu	to do (polite form of "する")
Step 5: Indicative Sentence Structure
[next Osaka-bound train] [?] [which platform] [?] [leave] [?]
→ 次の大阪行きの電車 [?] 何番線 [?] 出ます [?]

[remaining time] [?] [depart] [?]
→ あとどれくらい [?] 出発します [?]

Step 6: Hints for Understanding
Why is "の" used in "大阪行きの電車"?
→ "の" links "Osaka-bound" (大阪行き) and "train" (電車), making it "the train bound for Osaka."

Why do we use "から" after "何番線"?
→ "から" means "from," so "何番線から" means "from which platform."

Why is "あと" used before "どれくらい"?
→ "あと" means "remaining" or "left," so "あとどれくらい" asks "how much time is left."

Final Thoughts
This translation keeps the original intent, is natural-sounding, and is polite but not too formal—perfect for asking at a train station! Try to analyze the structure yourself and practice saying it aloud. 🚆😊

Notes
- Unbelievably slow on first-time use - 3-5 seconds per word - yes, not 3-5 words per second - timed out on network error - snappier on later runs
- assume that latency and more importantly variability less of an issue on paid provision but another tick in the local approach as consistency often very important as well as raw speed! 
- strong response above with these two sections potentially forming the basis of the ask
-- vocab table good w/ combined kanji/kana (romaji) column
-- indicative sentence structure as requested
