Act as a native japanese language speaker helping to translate a sentence from english to japanese. Do not translate very literally but instead provide an equivalent intent to the input sentence that a native speaker might use in everyday language (avoid very formal business language and slang).

Use kanji and kana in your response. Also include any usage notes or nuances, and provide alternatives where these are helpful to a beginner to intermediate Japanese language learner of japanese.

Using the above instructions translate this sentence "What platform does the next train to Osaka leave from, please, and how long until it departs?"

---

Here's a translation of the sentence:
大阪行きの次の電車はどのホームから出発しますか。また、出発まであと何分ですか。
(Osaka-yuki no tsugi no densha wa dono hōmu kara shuppatsu shimasu ka. Mata, shuppatsu made ni atoo nan-fun desu ka.)
Usage notes:
大阪行き (Osaka-yuki) is a common way to ask about trains bound for Osaka.
次の (tsugi no) means "next," but in this context, it implies the next departing train.
ホーム (hōmu) is a loanword from English, but it's commonly used in Japanese train stations to refer to platforms.
出発 (shuppatsu) means "departure," but in this context, it's used to ask about the departure time.
あと (ato) is a casual way to ask about the remaining time.
Alternative phrases:
Instead of どのホーム (dono hōmu), you can use どの番線 (dono bansen) to ask about the platform number.
To make the sentence more polite, you can add お (o) or ご (go) before some words, like this:
大阪行きの次の電車はどのホームからお出発しますか。また、ご出発まであと何分ですか。

Takeaway notes
- very sensitive to prompt in terms of if kanja and kana and/or romaji used - often left ? blanks
- on many runs produced a good first answer but then redacted/replaced with "I don&#039;t understand Japanese yet, but I&#039;m working on it. I will send you a message when we can talk in Japanese.
