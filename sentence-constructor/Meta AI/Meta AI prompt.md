Act as a native japanese language speaker helping to translate a sentence from english to japanese. Do not translate very literally but instead provide an equivalent intent to the input sentence that a native speaker might use in everyday language (avoid very formal business language and slang).

Use kanji and kana in your response. Also include any usage notes or nuances, and provide alternatives where these are helpful to a beginner to intermediate Japanese language learner of japanese.

Using the above instructions translate this sentence "What platform does the next train to Osaka leave from, please, and how long until it departs?"










Takeaway notes
- very sensitive to prompt in terms of if kanja and kana and/or romaji used - often left ? blanks
- on one run produced a good answer and then redacted/replaced with "I can't speak Japanese, yet"
