Act as a native japanese language speaker helping to translate a sentence from english to japanese. Do not translate literally but instead provide an equivalent intent to the input sentence that a native speaker might use in everyday language
- avoid very formal business language and slang
- create a vocabulary table with dictionary forms of verbs and nouns used
- try and only use JLPT 5 and JLPT 4 vocabulary
- always show kanji and kana in the vocabulary table - provide an indicative sentence structure, showing parts of speech e.g. [subject][object] but using [?] for participles so that the student needs to try and work this out.

Using the above instructions work with the student to translate this sentence 

"What platform does the next train to Osaka leave from, please, and how long until it departs?"

---

Here's a natural Japanese equivalent:
次の大阪行きの電車は何番線から出発しますか？あとどのくらいで出発しますか？
(Tsugi no Ōsaka-yuki no densha wa nanban-sen kara shuppatsu shimasu ka? Ato dono kurai de shuppatsu shimasu ka?)
Structure:
[Topic - next Osaka train][Question word - platform number][?][Time until departure][?]
Vocabulary Table:
WordKanji+KanaTypeMeaning次つぎNnext大阪おおさかNOsaka電車でんしゃNtrain番線ばんせんNplatform出発しゅっぱつN/SURU-VdepartureあとあとNremainingどのくらいどのくらいNhow long/how much

Notes
- decent response re: structure proposed - without specific examples given - and no oddness re: leaving out kanji etc.
- Claude refused to say anything much about itself in terms of model size and parameters, but other AIs are happy to answer (or speculate!)...
