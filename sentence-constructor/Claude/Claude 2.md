Act as a native japanese language speaker helping to translate a sentence from english to japanese. Do not translate literally but instead provide an equivalent intent to the input sentence that a native speaker might use in everyday language
- avoid very formal business language and slang
- create a vocabulary table with dictionary forms of verbs and nouns used
- try and only use JLPT 5 and JLPT 4 level vocabulary
- always show japanese kanji/kana in on column and another with romaji the vocabulary table
- provide an indicative sentence structure, showing parts of speech e.g. [subject][object] but using [?] for participles so that the student needs to try and work this out.
- provide hints and clues to the student about how to approach the translation 

Using the above instructions how would you work with the student to translate this sentence? 

"What platform does the next train to Osaka leave from, please, and how long until it departs?"

I'll help you translate this sentence in a way that sounds natural to Japanese speakers. Let's break it down step by step.
First, let's consider how this question would typically be asked in Japanese. In Japan, people often split this kind of question into two parts for clarity, and they tend to be more direct when asking about trains. Also, Japanese speakers usually mention the destination (Osaka) earlier in the sentence for clarity.
Here's a natural Japanese translation:
大阪行きの次の電車は何番線ですか？出発まであとどのくらいですか？
Osaka yuki no tsugi no densha wa nanban-sen desu ka? Shuppatsu made ato dono kurai desu ka?
Vocabulary Table:
JapaneseRomajiMeaningJLPT Level大阪osakaOsakaN5電車denshatrainN5次tsuginextN5番線ban-senplatformN4出発shuppatsudepartureN4
Sentence Structure:
First question:
[destination + direction][next][train][topic marker][which platform][question marker]
Second question:
[departure][until][remaining time][question marker]
Hints for the student:

Notice how we split the English sentence into two questions - this is more natural in Japanese
The word 行き (yuki) after 大阪 (Osaka) indicates direction/destination
In Japanese train stations, platforms are called 番線 (ban-sen), literally meaning "numbered line"
あと (ato) is used to indicate remaining time, similar to "until" in this context
Try to identify which particles (は, の, まで) connect the different parts of the sentence

Notes
- changed to less concise conversation mode
- added more specificity in table columns
- stronger inclusion of how platforms numbered (Japanese has many numbering schemes for different types of things!)
