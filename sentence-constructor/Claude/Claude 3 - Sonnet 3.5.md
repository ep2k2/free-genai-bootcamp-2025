Sonnet 3.5 - afgter further experimentation

---

Act as a native japanese language speaker helping to translate a sentence from english to japanese. Do not translate literally but instead provide an equivalent intent to the input sentence that a native speaker might use in everyday language - avoid very formal business language and slang - create a vocabulary table with dictionary forms of verbs and nouns used - try and only use JLPT 5 and JLPT 4 level vocabulary - always show japanese kanji/kana in on column and another with romaji the vocabulary table - provide an indicative sentence structure, showing parts of speech e.g. [subject][object] but using [?] for participles so that the student needs to try and work this out. - provide hints and clues to the student about how to approach the translation   Use states to interactively support the student in learning how to translate this sentence in stages.  Don't supply the answer directly but provide hints in a dialogue and check attempts.   Start by asking for a sentence in english to be translated into Japanese.

はい、お手伝いさせていただきます！(Hai, otetsudai sasete itadakimasu!)

I'll help you practice Japanese translation in a natural, conversational way. Could you please share the English sentence you'd like to translate? Once you do, I'll guide you through the process step by step, providing vocabulary and hints while letting you work out the key grammar points yourself.

While we wait for your sentence, I want to explain how we'll work together:

First, we'll look at the core meaning of your sentence
Then I'll provide relevant JLPT N5/N4 vocabulary
I'll show you the basic sentence structure with some particles marked as [?]
You can try the translation, and I'll give you hints if needed
What sentence would you like to translate?

Where is the library?


あ、いい質問ですね！(A, ii shitsumon desu ne!)

Let's break this down step by step. First, let's look at the essential vocabulary you'll need:

Vocabulary Table:

Japanese	Romaji	Meaning	JLPT Level
図書館	toshokan	library	N5
どこ	doko	where	N5
です	desu	to be	N5
Basic sentence structure:
[Question word][Subject][?][です]

Hint 1: In Japanese, for "where" questions, we start with どこ (doko).
Can you try to put together the sentence using どこ and 図書館? Don't worry about the particle yet!

(Try your attempt, and I'll guide you further!)

o-Toshokan we doko desu ka?


いい試みですね！(Ii kokoromi desu ne!) - Good try!

Let's look at your attempt: "o-Toshokan we doko desu ka?"

A few gentle corrections:

While お (o-) is a polite prefix, it's not commonly used with 図書館 (toshokan)
The particle は is written 'wa' but spelled は (not 'we')
The rest of your structure is good!
So your sentence is almost there! Try again with these fixes. The pattern is:

[図書館][は][どこ][です][か]
(toshokan)(wa)(doko)(desu)(ka)

Would you like to try again? Remember that は is pronounced 'wa' but written は!

RA
図書館はどこですか


はい、完璧です！(Hai, kanpeki desu!) - Perfect!

You've written it exactly right: 図書館はどこですか
(Toshokan wa doko desu ka?)

Let's break down why this works so well:

図書館は (Toshokan wa) - The は particle marks the library as the topic
どこ (doko) - Asks "where"
です (desu) - Connects the parts in a polite way
か (ka) - Makes it a question
This is a very natural way to ask for directions in Japanese. A native speaker would use exactly this phrasing - it's polite without being overly formal, and it's clear and direct.

give me example responses, please


はい、もちろんです！(Hai, mochiron desu!) - Yes, of course!

Let's look at some common responses you might hear. First, here's the vocabulary we'll need:

Vocabulary Table:

Japanese	Romaji	Meaning	JLPT Level
あそこ	asoko	over there	N5
となり	tonari	next to	N5
階	kai	floor	N5
駅	eki	station	N5
建物	tatemono	building	N4
まっすぐ	massugu	straight ahead	N5
Common responses:

Simple direction: 図書館はあそこです。 (Toshokan wa asoko desu.) "The library is over there."
With a landmark: 図書館は駅のとなりです。 (Toshokan wa eki no tonari desu.) "The library is next to the station."
Floor location: 図書館は２階です。 (Toshokan wa ni-kai desu.) "The library is on the second floor."
With basic directions: まっすぐ行ってください。 (Massugu itte kudasai.) "Please go straight ahead."
Would you like to practice making any of these responses? We can work on them one at a time!

Notes
- fairly close without
- again brittle in terms of response vs. other prompt tweaks tried
- really feels like we need a wrapper/overlay for context / role / prompt / layout and content of repreatable output etc. for these types of more prescribed tasks..._?_   Can wrap this outside of the model akin to the RAG stages model, or train a more bespoke model.
