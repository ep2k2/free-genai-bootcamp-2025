# GenAI-related governance frameworks (for NFRs, organisations maturity and governance of change aspects)
- naturally consultancies and vendors - like EY, IBM _etc._ all have maturity models repurposed to target GenAI
-- this maturity model https://www.genai.global/frameworks/GenAI_Maturity_Model.pdf which shows a four domain maturity approach (I noted the transparency/traceability/monitor/improve-flavoured domain in particular)
-- a model aimed at managing change in this space is the FASTER framework out of Vanderbilt University: at the risk of acronym overload...

 F ocus: Clearly define the focus and scope of the change initiative.
 A ctivate: Engage and mobilize stakeholders to support the change.
 S upport: Provide the necessary resources and support to facilitate the change.
 T rack: Monitor progress and measure the impact of the change.
 E valuate: Assess the outcomes and make necessary adjustments.
 R efine: Continuously improve and refine the change process based on feedback and evaluation.

There is a Coursera course here https://www.coursera.org/learn/change-management-generative-ai#modules presented by Dr. Jules White, Bob Higgins... might be something of interest later, especially if you are in or want to be in a position to introduce GenAI into an organisation❔)

-- added 08/02/25 - additionally I have found another FASTER framework in the control and governance space: this one from and for Canadian government - different purpose and this time Fair, Accountable, Secure, Transparent, Educated, Relevant (popular acronym❣️)
